 abstract = {The heats of formation and the normalized clustering energies (NCEs) for the group 4 and group 6 transition metal oxide (TMO) trimers and tetramers have been calculated by the Feller–Peterson–Dixon (FPD) method. The heats of formation predicted by the FPD method do not differ much from those previously derived from the NCEs at the CCSD(T)/aT level except for the CrO3 nanoclusters. New and improved heats of formation for Cr3O9 and Cr4O12 were obtained using PW91 orbitals instead of Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals. Diffuse functions are necessary to predict accurate heats of formation. The fluoride affinities (FAs) are calculated with the CCSD(T) method. The relative energies (REs) of different isomers, NCEs, electron affinities (EAs), and FAs of (MO2)n (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, n = 1–4) and (MO3)n (M = Cr, Mo, W, n = 1–3) clusters have been benchmarked with 55 exchange-correlation density functional theory (DFT) functionals including both pure and hybrid types. The absolute errors of the DFT results are mostly less than ±10 kcal/mol for the NCEs and the EAs and less than ±15 kcal/mol for the FAs. Hybrid functionals usually perform better than the pure functionals for the REs and NCEs. The performance of the two types of functionals in predicting EAs and FAs is comparable. The B1B95 and PBE1PBE functionals provide reliable energetic properties for most isomers. Long range corrected pure functionals usually give poor FAs. The standard deviation of the absolute error is always close to the mean errors, and the probability distributions of the DFT errors are often not Gaussian (normal). The breadth of the distribution of errors and the maximum probability are dependent on the energy property and the isomer.}

 abstract={The use of ionic liquids (ILs) as media in radical polymerizations has demonstrated the ability of these unique solvents to improve both reaction kinetics and polymer product properties. However, the bulk of these studies have examined the polymerization behavior of common organic monomers (e.g., methyl methacrylate, styrene) dissolved in conventional ILs. There is increasing interest in polymerized ILs (poly(ILs)), which are ionomers produced from the direct polymerization of styrene-, vinyl-, and acrylate-functionalized ILs. Here, the photopolymerization kinetics of IL monomers are investigated for systems in which styrene or vinyl functionalities are pendant from the imidazolium cation. Styrene-functionalized IL monomers typically polymerized rapidly (full conversion ≤1 min) in both neat compositions or when diluted with a nonpolymerizable IL, [C2mim][Tf2N]. However, monomer conversion in vinyl-functionalized IL monomers is much more dependent on the nature of the nonpolymerizable group. ATR-FTIR analysis and molecular simulations of these monomers and monomer mixtures identified the presence of multiple intermolecular interactions (e.g., π–π stacking, IL aggregation) that contribute to the polymerization behaviors of these systems.}

Yet, there is no fundamental limitation or reason as to why tri- or tetra-functionalized imidazolium cations have received far less attention. Scant physical property data exist for just a few trifunctionalized imidazolium-based ILs and there is virtually no data on tetra-functionalized ILs. Thus, there are a broad experimental spaces on the “map” of ILs that are largely unexplored. We have sought to make an initial expedition into these “uncharted waters” and have synthesized imidazolium-based ILs with one more functional group(s) at the C(2), C(4), and/or C(5) positions of the imidazolium ring (as well as N(1) and N(3)). This manuscript reports the synthesis and experimental densities of these tri- and tetra-functionalized ILs as well as calculated densities and fractional free volumes from COSMOTherm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of any detailed experimental measurements or computational studies relating to ILs with substitutions at the C(4) and C(5) positions.}

The concentration dependence of shear viscosity was obtained with low statistical uncertainties to allow for calculation of the viscosity Jones-Dole B-coefficients. No prior values are available for the B-coefficients from molecular simulations of fully atomistic models for electrolyte solutions. In addition, we obtained diffusion coefficients with rigorous finite-size corrections to access ion mobilities; these provide insights on single ion hydration behaviour. We find that all models studied, even polarisable and scaled-charge models, quantitatively over-predict water structuring but qualitatively follow the experimentally determined Hofmeister series. All ion models considered are kosmotropes based on their calculated B-coefficient and diffusion coefficients, even for ions experimentally found to be chaotropes. These observations indicate that the water-ion interactions in these models are not adequately represented; additional interactions such as charge transfer must be incorporated in future models in order to better represent electrolyte solution properties.}

In this work, we evaluate the vapor pressure of a scaled-charge sodium chloride (NaCl) force field and compare the results against experiments and a non-polarizable full-charge force field. The scaled-charge force field predicts a higher vapor pressure than found in experiments, due to its overprediction of the liquid-phase chemical potential. Reanalyzing the trajectories generated from the scaled-charge model with full charges improves the estimation of the liquid-phase chemical potential but not the vapor pressure.}

 abstract = {Among the many existing molecular models of water, the MB-pol many-body potential has emerged as a remarkably accurate model, capable of reproducing thermodynamic, structural, and dynamic properties across water’s solid, liquid, and vapor phases. In this work, we assessed the performance of MB-pol with respect to an important set of properties related to vapor–liquid coexistence and interfacial behavior. Through direct coexistence classical molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures of 400 K < T < 600 K, we calculated properties such as equilibrium coexistence densities, vapor–liquid interfacial tension, vapor pressure, and enthalpy of vaporization and compared the MB-pol results to experimental data. We also compared rigid vs fully flexible variants of the MB-pol model and evaluated system size effects for the properties studied. We found that the MB-pol model predictions are in good agreement with experimental data, even for temperatures approaching the vapor–liquid critical point; this agreement was largely insensitive to system sizes or the rigid vs flexible treatment of the intramolecular degrees of freedom. These results attest to the chemical accuracy of MB-pol and its high degree of transferability, thus enabling MB-pol’s application across a large swath of water’s phase diagram.}

Such models have become increasingly popular in molecular simulations given their ability to learn highly complex and multi-dimensional interactions within a local environment; however, many of them fundamentally lack a description of explicit long-range interactions. In order to provide a well-defined benchmark system with precisely known pairwise interactions, we chose as the reference model a flexible version of the Extended Simple Point Charge (SPC/E) water model. Our analysis shows that while local representations are sufficient for predictions of the condensed liquid phase, the short-range nature of machine-learning models falls short in representing cluster and vapor phase properties. These findings provide an improved understanding of the role of long-range interactions in machine learning models and the regimes where they are necessary.}

The DNN potential was found to match DFT results for the structural, transport, and short-time chemical reactions in the melt. Using the DNN potential, we extended the time scales of observation to 2 ns in systems containing thousands of atoms, while preserving quantum chemical accuracy. This allowed us to reach chemical equilibrium with respect to several chemical species in the melt. The approach can be generalized for a broad spectrum of chemically reactive systems.}

Building upon the many-body expansion formalism, we construct a series of MB-nrg models by fitting one-body and two-body reference energies calculated at the coupled cluster level of theory for large monomer and dimer training sets. Advancing from the first generation models, we employ the charge model 5 scheme to determine the atomic charges and systematically scale the two-body energies to obtain more accurate descriptions of vapor, liquid, and vapor–liquid equilibrium properties. Challenges in model construction arise due to the anisotropic nature and small magnitude of the interaction energies in CO2, calling for the necessity of highly accurate descriptions of the multidimensional energy landscape of liquid CO2. These findings emphasize the key role played by the training set quality in the development of transferable, data-driven models, which, accurately representing high-dimensional many-body effects, can enable predictive computer simulations of molecular fluids across the entire phase diagram.}

 abstract = {Salt water is ubiquitous, playing crucial roles in geological and physiological processes. Despite centuries of investigations, whether or not water’s structure is drastically changed by dissolved ions is still debated. Based on density functional theory, we employ machine learning based molecular dynamics to model sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bromide solutions at different concentrations. The resulting reciprocal-space structure factors agree quantitatively with neutron diffraction data. Here we provide clear evidence that the ions in salt water do not distort the structure of water in the same way as neat water responds to elevated pressure. Rather, the computed structural changes are restricted to the ionic first solvation shells intruding into the hydrogen bond network, beyond which the oxygen radial-distribution function does not undergo major change relative to neat water. Our findings suggest that the widely cited pressure-like effect on the solvent in Hofmeister series ionic solutions should be carefully revisited.}

Although our models are trained only with liquid-phase configurations, they are able to simulate a stable interfacial system and predict vapor–liquid equilibrium properties, in good agreement with results from the literature. Because of the computational efficiency of the models, we are also able to obtain transport properties, such as viscosity and diffusion coefficients. We find that the SCAN-based model presents a temperature shift in the position of the critical point, while the SCAN-rvv10-based model shows improvement but still exhibits a temperature shift that remains approximately constant for all properties investigated in this work. We find that the BLYP-D3-based model generally performs better for the liquid phase and vapor–liquid equilibrium properties, but the PBE-D3-based model is better suited for predicting transport properties.}

Models with reduced (scaled) charges do better for solution diffusivities and viscosities but encounter issues describing other dynamic phenomena such as nucleation rates of crystals from solution. Polarizable models show promise, especially when appropriately parametrized, but may still miss important physical effects such as charge transfer. First-principles calculations are starting to emerge for these properties that are in principle able to capture polarization, charge transfer, and chemical transformations in solution.

Here, inspired by similarities in structural and functional requirements between electrochromic devices and ECRAMs, high-performance, single-transistor and neuromorphic devices based on electrochromic polymers (ECPs) are demonstrated. To effectively translate electrochromism into electrochemical ion memory in polymers, this study systematically investigates polymer–ion interactions, redox activity, mixed ionic–electronic conduction, and stability of ECPs both experimentally and computationally using select electrolytes. The best-performing ECP-electrolyte combination is then implemented into an ECRAM device to further explore synaptic plasticity behaviors. The resulting ECRAM exhibits high linearity and symmetric conductance modulation, high dynamic range (≈1 mS or ≈6x), and high training accuracy (>84% within five training cycles on a standard image recognition dataset), comparable to existing state-of-the-art ECRAMs. This study offers a promising approach to discover and design novel polymer materials for organic ECRAMs and demonstrates potential applications, taking advantage of mature knowledge basis on electrochromic materials and devices.}

We introduce an open-source code to modify MOFs through functionalization and linker rotation and we perform Grand Canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of methane in each of the functionalized and linker-rotated derivatives of UiO-66. We find that linker rotation moderately influences methane uptake and significantly influences methane diffusion. Our assessment provides ranges of property values that serve as measures of uncertainty of these two properties associated with linker rotation. We further determine that void volume fraction and minimum pore size are the features that govern methane uptake and diffusion, respectively. These findings illustrate the impact of linker rotation on MOFs and provide design principles to guide future investigations.}

Notably, the decrease in the dielectric permittivity as a function of concentration, computed using the DNN approach, agrees well with experiments. Detailed analysis of the computations reveals that the dominant effect, caused by the intrusion of ionic hydration shells into the solvent hydrogen-bond network, is the disruption of dipolar correlations among water molecules. Accordingly, the observed decrease in the dielectric permittivity is mostly due to increasing suppression of the collective response of solvent waters.}

We curate a data set of 563 alkali metal coordinating molecular complexes (i.e., with Li+, Na+, or K+) from the Cambridge Structural Database and calculate differential ion binding energies using density functional theory. Using this information, we probe when and why structures favor exchange with alternate ions. Our analysis reveals that energetic preferences are related to ion size but are largely due to chemical interactions rather than structural reorganization. We identify unique trends in the selectivity for Li+ over other alkali ions, including the presence of N coordination atoms, planar coordination geometry, and small coordinating ring sizes. We use machine learning models to identify the key contributions of both geometric and electronic features in predicting selective ion binding. These physical insights offer preliminary guidance into the design of optimal membranes for ion selectivity.}
