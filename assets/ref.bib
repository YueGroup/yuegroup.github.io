 abstract = {The heats of formation and the normalized clustering energies (NCEs) for the group 4 and group 6 transition metal oxide (TMO) trimers and tetramers have been calculated by the Feller–Peterson–Dixon (FPD) method. The heats of formation predicted by the FPD method do not differ much from those previously derived from the NCEs at the CCSD(T)/aT level except for the CrO3 nanoclusters. New and improved heats of formation for Cr3O9 and Cr4O12 were obtained using PW91 orbitals instead of Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals. Diffuse functions are necessary to predict accurate heats of formation. The fluoride affinities (FAs) are calculated with the CCSD(T) method. The relative energies (REs) of different isomers, NCEs, electron affinities (EAs), and FAs of (MO2)n (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, n = 1–4) and (MO3)n (M = Cr, Mo, W, n = 1–3) clusters have been benchmarked with 55 exchange-correlation density functional theory (DFT) functionals including both pure and hybrid types. The absolute errors of the DFT results are mostly less than ±10 kcal/mol for the NCEs and the EAs and less than ±15 kcal/mol for the FAs. Hybrid functionals usually perform better than the pure functionals for the REs and NCEs. The performance of the two types of functionals in predicting EAs and FAs is comparable. The B1B95 and PBE1PBE functionals provide reliable energetic properties for most isomers. Long range corrected pure functionals usually give poor FAs. The standard deviation of the absolute error is always close to the mean errors, and the probability distributions of the DFT errors are often not Gaussian (normal). The breadth of the distribution of errors and the maximum probability are dependent on the energy property and the isomer.},

 abstract={The use of ionic liquids (ILs) as media in radical polymerizations has demonstrated the ability of these unique solvents to improve both reaction kinetics and polymer product properties. However, the bulk of these studies have examined the polymerization behavior of common organic monomers (e.g., methyl methacrylate, styrene) dissolved in conventional ILs. There is increasing interest in polymerized ILs (poly(ILs)), which are ionomers produced from the direct polymerization of styrene-, vinyl-, and acrylate-functionalized ILs. Here, the photopolymerization kinetics of IL monomers are investigated for systems in which styrene or vinyl functionalities are pendant from the imidazolium cation. Styrene-functionalized IL monomers typically polymerized rapidly (full conversion ≤1 min) in both neat compositions or when diluted with a nonpolymerizable IL, [C2mim][Tf2N]. However, monomer conversion in vinyl-functionalized IL monomers is much more dependent on the nature of the nonpolymerizable group. ATR-FTIR analysis and molecular simulations of these monomers and monomer mixtures identified the presence of multiple intermolecular interactions (e.g., π–π stacking, IL aggregation) that contribute to the polymerization behaviors of these systems.}

 abstract = {Although it has been estimated that there are at least 1 million ionic liquids (ILs) that are accessible using commercially available starting materials, a great portion of the ILs that have been experimentally synthesized, characterized, and studied in a variety of applications are built around the relatively simple 1-n-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ([Cnmim]) cation motif. Yet, there is no fundamental limitation or reason as to why tri- or tetra-functionalized imidazolium cations have received far less attention. Scant physical property data exist for just a few trifunctionalized imidazolium-based ILs and there is virtually no data on tetra-functionalized ILs. Thus, there are a broad experimental spaces on the “map” of ILs that are largely unexplored. We have sought to make an initial expedition into these “uncharted waters” and have synthesized imidazolium-based ILs with one more functional group(s) at the C(2), C(4), and/or C(5) positions of the imidazolium ring (as well as N(1) and N(3)). This manuscript reports the synthesis and experimental densities of these tri- and tetra-functionalized ILs as well as calculated densities and fractional free volumes from COSMOTherm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of any detailed experimental measurements or computational studies relating to ILs with substitutions at the C(4) and C(5) positions.}
